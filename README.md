# how to make git commit
 1. git add . , where . signifies all. If you want add just one you can just specify that one file
 2. git status -> this checks if the git is staged or not. Git stages the file by git add before commiting.
 3. git commit -m "text here", where -m stands for message.
 4. git log -> you can see all changes.
 5. git log --oneline adf
 6. checkout commit, revert commit, reset commit
 - checkout commit: going back in time and seeing history. Not altering anything.
 - revert commit: stil very commit, not quite (Undo particular commit)
 - Reset commit: unsafe, might ruin your repository (permanently go back in time)
